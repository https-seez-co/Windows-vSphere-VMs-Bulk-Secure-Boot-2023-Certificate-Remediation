.SYNOPSIS
    Bulk Secure Boot 2023 certificate remediation for VMware VMs on ESXi 8.
    Optionally takes a snapshot before making any changes. Includes rollback,
    snapshot cleanup, and NVRAM cleanup modes for post-validation housekeeping.
    Includes a read-only assessment mode (-Assess) and hardware version upgrade
    mode (-UpgradeHardware).

    Process per VM (default):
    0. BitLocker safety check
    1. Take snapshot (skipped with -NoSnapshot)
    2. Power off
    2b. Upgrade hardware version (only if -UpgradeHardware specified)
    3. Rename .nvram -> .nvram_old (ESXi regenerates with 2023 KEK on next boot)
    4. Power on, wait for Tools, verify 2023 certs in new NVRAM
    5. Clear any stale Servicing registry state
    6. Set AvailableUpdates = 0x5944, trigger Secure-Boot-Update task
    7. Reboot, trigger task again
    8. Verify final status
    9. Remove snapshot on success (unless -RetainSnapshots or -NoSnapshot)

.PARAMETER VMName
    One or more VM display names. Accepts wildcards. Can be combined with
    -VMListCsv - both sources are merged and deduplicated.
    If neither VMName nor VMListCsv is specified, targets all in-scope
    Windows Server VMs with Secure Boot enabled (main mode) or all Windows
    Server VMs (cleanup/rollback modes).

.PARAMETER VMListCsv
    Path to a CSV file containing VM names to target. The CSV must have a
    column named "VMName". Any other columns are ignored, which means you can
    feed the script's own output CSVs directly back in as input to re-run or
    clean up a specific batch. Can be combined with -VMName.

.PARAMETER GuestCredential
    Guest OS credential (domain admin). Required for the main remediation
    mode. Not required for -CleanupSnapshots, -CleanupNvram, or -Rollback.

.PARAMETER NoSnapshot
    Skip snapshot creation entirely. Use when datastore space is constrained
    or snapshots are managed externally. Cannot be combined with
    -RetainSnapshots. Note: without a snapshot there is no automated rollback
    path - the -Rollback mode will still restore the .nvram_old file if one
    exists, but cannot revert VM state (registry changes etc.).

.PARAMETER SkipNVRAMRename
    Skip the NVRAM rename step (steps 2-4) entirely. The VM will not be powered
    off, the NVRAM file will not be renamed, and ESXi will not regenerate the
    NVRAM. Use this when the KEK 2023 certificate is already present in the VM's
    NVRAM (e.g. VMs created on ESXi 8.0.2+ or already remediated via another
    method) and you only want to use the script for cert update triggering and
    PK enrollment. This avoids any risk associated with NVRAM file manipulation.
    The script will proceed directly to step 5 (cert update trigger).

.PARAMETER Confirm
    Suppress the "Continue? (Y/N)" prompt and proceed automatically. Use this
    when running the script unattended or in a scheduled task, and you have
    already verified sufficient datastore space for snapshots.

.PARAMETER RetainSnapshots
    Keep snapshots even on success. Use this when you want to validate VMs
    over a period of days before removing snapshots. Use -CleanupSnapshots
    later to remove them. Cannot be combined with -NoSnapshot.

.PARAMETER CleanupSnapshots
    Removes all Pre-SecureBoot-Fix* snapshots on target VMs. Does not require
    -GuestCredential. Can be combined with -CleanupHWSnapshots and -CleanupNvram
    in a single run. When combined, ordering is enforced internally: SecureBoot-Fix
    snapshots are removed first, then HWUpgrade snapshots, then .nvram_old files.
    Non-managed child snapshots on a VM will cause that snapshot to be skipped
    with a warning.

.PARAMETER CleanupHWSnapshots
    Removes all Pre-HWUpgrade* snapshots created by standalone -UpgradeHardware
    runs. Does not require -GuestCredential. Can be combined with -CleanupSnapshots
    and -CleanupNvram. If a Pre-HWUpgrade snapshot has Pre-SecureBoot-Fix child
    snapshots, it will be skipped unless -CleanupSnapshots is also specified, in
    which case the children are removed first automatically.

.PARAMETER CleanupNvram
    Deletes all .nvram_old files left on target VM datastores. Does not require
    -GuestCredential. Can be combined with -CleanupSnapshots and -CleanupHWSnapshots.
    When combined, .nvram_old files are always deleted last, after all snapshots
    have been removed. If run alone while Pre-SecureBoot-Fix* snapshots still exist,
    a warning is logged but deletion proceeds - no rollback path will remain.

.PARAMETER Rollback
    Rollback mode. For each target VM:
      - Powers off the VM
      - Renames the current .nvram -> .nvram_new (preserves it)
      - Renames .nvram_old -> .nvram (restores original NVRAM)
      - Reverts to the Pre-SecureBoot-Fix* snapshot if one exists
      - Powers the VM back on
    Does not require -GuestCredential. If no snapshot exists the NVRAM is
    still restored, but VM state (registry changes etc.) will not be reverted.

.PARAMETER BitLockerBackupShare
    UNC path to a writable file share for BitLocker recovery key backups. When
    provided, VMs with active BitLocker are processed rather than skipped. The
    script exports all recovery keys to the share as VMName_BitLockerKeys_<timestamp>.txt
    before making any changes, aborts if the backup fails, then suspends BitLocker
    for the duration of the remediation. If PK remediation also runs (step 9),
    a second backup and suspension are performed before the SetupMode reboot.
    Without this parameter, any VM with active BitLocker is skipped with a warning.
    Example: \\fileserver\BitLockerKeys

.PARAMETER PKDerPath
    Path to WindowsOEMDevicesPK.der downloaded from the Microsoft secureboot_objects
    GitHub repository. When provided, the script enrolls a valid Platform Key on any
    VM where the PK is NULL, invalid, or an ESXi-generated placeholder (Valid_Other)
    after cert remediation. VMs with a proper Microsoft or OEM PK are skipped.

    Download:
    https://github.com/microsoft/secureboot_objects/blob/main/PreSignedObjects/PK/Certificate/WindowsOEMDevicesPK.der

    Required for step 9 PK remediation. If omitted, invalid/placeholder PKs are
    reported in the output CSV but not remediated.

    NOTE: The script converts WindowsOEMDevicesPK.der from DER certificate
    format to EFI Signature List format internally via Format-SecureBootUEFI.
    No manual conversion is required.

.PARAMETER KEKDerPath
    Path to the Microsoft KEK 2K CA 2023 certificate in DER format. Optional - only
    needed if the KEK 2023 cert is somehow absent after NVRAM regeneration (should
    not occur on ESXi 8.0.2+). Download:
    https://github.com/microsoft/secureboot_objects/blob/main/PreSignedObjects/KEK/Certificates/microsoft%20corporation%20kek%202k%20ca%202023.der

.PARAMETER WaitSeconds
    Seconds to wait after issuing a reboot before polling for Tools.
    Default 90. Increase for slower VMs.

.PARAMETER GracefulShutdownTimeout
    Seconds to wait for a graceful guest OS shutdown before falling back to a
    hard power off. The script always attempts a graceful shutdown via VMware
    Tools first (equivalent to clicking Shut Down in Windows). If the guest has
    not powered off within this timeout, a hard power off is issued automatically.
    Default 120. Set to 0 to skip the graceful shutdown attempt and always use
    hard power off.

.PARAMETER InterVMDelay
    Seconds to wait between processing each VM. Useful when remediating paired
    or co-dependent VMs (e.g. primary/secondary, database/app server) where the
    first VM needs time to fully start its services before the next VM is processed.
    Default 0 (no delay). The delay is applied after each VM completes, except
    the last VM in the batch.

.PARAMETER IgnoreCertificateWarnings
    When specified, sets PowerCLI InvalidCertificateAction to Ignore for the
    current session before connecting to vCenter. Only use this if your vCenter
    uses a self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificate and you have accepted
    that risk. Omitting this flag leaves your existing PowerCLI certificate
    configuration unchanged. If your vCenter has a properly signed certificate
    this flag is not needed and should not be used.

.PARAMETER vCenter
    Hostname or IP address of the vCenter server to connect to. If not specified
    and no existing vCenter connection is active, the script will prompt for a
    server name. If an existing connection is already open the script uses it
    and this parameter is ignored.

.PARAMETER Assess
    Read-only assessment mode. No changes are made to any VM. Collects current
    state for all target VMs and outputs a CSV and console summary identifying
    which VMs need remediation and what steps are required. Includes hardware
    version, ESXi host version, firmware type, Secure Boot state, KEK/DB/PK
    certificate status, registry deployment status, event log signals, BitLocker
    state, and snapshot/nvram_old presence.
    If -GuestCredential is provided, guest-level data (cert status, registry,
    events, BitLocker) is collected from powered-on VMs with Tools running.
    If -GuestCredential is omitted, only hypervisor-level data is collected.
    No VMs are powered on or off. Mutually exclusive with all action modes.

.PARAMETER UpgradeHardware
    Upgrades VM hardware version to the latest version supported by the host.
    Hardware version 21 or later is required for ESXi to populate regenerated
    NVRAM with the 2023 KEK certificate.
    Standalone use (-UpgradeHardware only, no -GuestCredential): powers off
    each VM, takes a snapshot by default for rollback purposes, upgrades
    hardware version, powers back on. Use -NoSnapshot to skip the snapshot.
    Combined use (-UpgradeHardware with -GuestCredential): hardware upgrade is
    performed between step 2 (power off) and step 3 (NVRAM rename) as part of
    the full remediation sequence; the snapshot taken at step 1 serves as the
    rollback point. VMs already at version 21 or later are skipped automatically.
    NOTE: VMware does not provide a supported API or UI method to downgrade VM
    hardware versions. A snapshot is the only supported rollback path. Reverting
    to the pre-upgrade snapshot restores the previous hardware version.

.NOTES
    Do not include domain controllers in automated runs - handle DCs manually.
    VMs with BitLocker active will be skipped unless -BitLockerBackupShare is
    provided, in which case recovery keys are backed up to the share and
    BitLocker is suspended for the duration of the process.
    PK remediation (-PKDerPath) requires ESXi 8.0+ hosts. VMs with a proper
    Microsoft or OEM PK (Valid_WindowsOEM / Valid_Microsoft) are skipped for the
    PK step automatically. ESXi-generated placeholder PKs (Valid_Other) are treated
    as needing enrollment per Broadcom KB 423919.
    References: Broadcom KB 423893, KB 423919, Microsoft secureboot_objects GitHub.
    Ensure sufficient datastore space for snapshots before running large batches.
    Requires VMware.PowerCLI module and an active vCenter connection, or
    the script will prompt for vCenter credentials on first run.
